### OPM: One-mode projection-based multilevel method for bipartite networks

You can get an alternative Python implementation of the OPM coarsening algorithm in [MFBN](https://github.com/alanvalejo/mfbn) repository. MFBN is a framework that compiles several coarsening algorithms for bipartite networks.
